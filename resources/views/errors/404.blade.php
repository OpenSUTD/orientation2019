Multinational climate refugee colony opens in Burlington
<br><br>
<br><br>CORSHAM, UK - May 15, 2244 - Celebrated artist and environmental activist Diego Manrique fought back tears today in a speech delivered on the steps of the newly opened Burlington Colony, hundreds of feet below the sprawling urban jungle of Corsham, Wiltshire.
<br><br>“I was only seventeen in 2223, when the waves rose up and swallowed the Canary Islands,” Manrique said. “The next decade of my life, I spent fighting for survival in the Wroughton Emergency Relocation Zone, our tents at the mercy of dust storms, heat waves and torrential rain.” Flanked by activist group leaders, fellow refugees and survivors, Manrique unveiled a series of three wall murals in the main tunnel-way of the Colony entrance, dedicated to climate casualties around the world. “As we step into the future of mankind’s survival, may they never be forgotten.”
<br><br>Third-Chance Party UK Prime Minister Lydia O’Connor, who first proposed the construction of the Colony, was among the first to tour the new complex. “ [Burlington] was once an emergency government war HQ. Today, it seems we are at war with Mother Earth herself. We must all do what we can to prepare ourselves, and I promise Burlington will be the first of many.”
<br><br>In contrast, main opposition candidate Oliver Byrne of the Revoke-1338 party was fiercely critical of the Colony. “Instead of pouring billions into glorified underground slums, we should have begun establishing lunar settlements a long time ago. There is nothing - no hope - left for us here.” Byrne’s remarks echo the sentiments of major opposition groups worldwide, as the Cheyenne, Sonnenberg, and Dixiacheng Colonies are just beginning operations. “It’s ridiculous. Not a single off-planet human… [DATA CORRUPTED]

<br><br>Investors rejoice as BNL shares rally after third colony established
<br><br>
<br><br>CAPE COLONY, FL - January 4, 2256 - After a surprise announcement by Bayer-Nowell Land Infrastructure [BNL] on Thursday, BNL investors began the year on a high with a stunning 7.3% hike in 24 hours.
<br><br>Despite the good news, analysts urge restraint, noting that the profitability of above-ground colonies tends to be unstable in the near-term. Bayer-Nowell will have to contend with the initial difficulties of managing over 70,000 people in the Cape Colony, their third and largest one yet, though co-founder and CEO Martin Nowell maintains that there will be “no issue, given our extensive track record in open-air climate-defense.
<br><br>BNL’s announcement comes closely on the heels of PANV Pharmaceutics’ [PANV] acquisition of Crater Lake, Raven Rock, and Brown Ridge, bringing their tally to 34 colonies. And after the messy dissolution of GZK Inc last month, PANV looks set to annex another six colonies in the former United Republic of Korea. Helmed by its four phenomenal directors, PANV has a clear lead, but in this post-government economy it remains to be seen if there isn’t enough room for multiple… [DATA CORRUPTED]

<br><br>Editorial: Cydroids - unhealthy fad, or future?
<br><br>April 14, 2271 - Call me old-fashioned, but there is something about a magical device that slows your aging (or so they claim) and projects your consciousness into a hollow, humanoid shell that gives me the heebie-jeebies. And now “Cydroid Pod Cafes”!? Next, you’re going to tell me Stim and Inebri8 are doing society a favor!

<br><br>Directors’ Meeting Minutes, July 24, 2273
<br><br>Trent Paver: ...the good news is, our initial analysis has brought up estimates that are off the charts. The bad news is that it’s stuck in big, dumb rocks, but Abby’s got it, right?
<br><br>Joanne Auborn: I’m not sure our Mk II’s can last for long in those conditions, let alone  get up there. And the Mk III’s are designed for extreme Earth environments.
<br><br>Mika Nakano: If I may interject, Kennedy’s old, but serviceable, and it shouldn’t be difficult to work on Luna for manufacturing our Mk IIIs once we get there..
<br><br>Robert Vetsch: I’ve been saying it all along, there’s heaps more potential in those rocks than we have left on terra firma. It’s bleeding-edge or nothing, and we can’t afford nothing.
<br><br>Trent Paver: Joanne, Mika, how long do you think it’ll take for the Mk III to get off the ground? Manpower won’t be a problem. The Cydroids themselves, though...
<br><br>Joanne Auborn: Nobody’s been up there in forever, so it’s anybody’s guess if the new plans work. At least, I certainly impressed myself with some of the new designs.
<br><br>Mika Nakano: Manufacturing’s squeezing as much as we can out of what we have left. That’s not much, even accounting for the recycled Mk I’s. We’re really doing this?
<br><br>Robert Vetsch: Damn right, we’re doing this. We’re going to space.
